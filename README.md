# Offline Wikipedia Demo

[Offline Wikipedia](https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com) is a demo of how a content site such as Wikipedia could offer offline content.

# Running locally

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run dev server:

```sh
npm run serve
```

Or, run without the offline capabilities:

```sh
npm run serve-no-sw
```

Running without offline capabilities means you get the latest version each time you hit refresh.
